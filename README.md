# Horus Monitoring

A remote monitoring system

UBC Sustaingineering is working in partnership with ENICALSA (Renewable solutions company in Nicaragua) to design and develop a 3G-network monitoring system for solar water pumps.

 Horus an electron based desktop application (MacOS, Windows, Linux) aims to facilitate the monitoring and data collection for the 30 currently installed solar panels in Nicargua.
