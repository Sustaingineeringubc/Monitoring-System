# Horus Monitoring

A remote monitoring system

UBC Sustaingineering is working in partnership with ENICALSA (Renewable solutions company in Nicaragua) to design and develop a 3G-network monitoring system for solar water pumps.

 Horus an electron based desktop application (MacOS, Windows, Linux) aims to facilitate the monitoring and data collection for the 30 currently installed solar panels in Nicargua.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites


(These are the general steps. This is still missing formating, content, but will serve as backbone for the whole file).
.:

1. Intalling npm and node JS

    1. Go to this site https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm and follow instructions

### Intalling

1. Clone this repo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

## Build

Building an electron project will generate an platfrom based native binary. This binary can then be used to install a Horus app distribution into Windows, MacOS and Linux.
