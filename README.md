# Horus Monitoring

A remote monitoring system

UBC Sustaingineering is working in partnership with ENICALSA (Renewable solutions company in Nicaragua) to design and develop a 3G-network monitoring system for solar water pumps.

 Horus an electron based desktop application (MacOS, Windows, Linux) aims to facilitate the monitoring and data collection for the 30 currently installed solar panels in Nicargua.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites


(These are the general steps. This is still missing formating, content, but will serve as backbone for the whole file).
.:
1. Open the terminal

3. Create this repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Sustaingineeringubc/Monitoring-System.git
    ```
    2. Once you’re in the folder, type git clone “link” https
4. Install npm
    1. Go to this site “”, then download node for your platform. Follow the wizard. Once you do, you can write node -v to check the current version, which implies it is connected. This installed both node and npm (node package manager)
5. Npm install
    1. This will download the dependencies in the JSON file inside the project. This will make all the libraries/code fully work!
6. Npm start!

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
